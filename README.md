# stem_map

STEM is a fast-growing field that's expected to keep growing. 
With this increase in STEM jobs it's important we educate students on STEM topics so that theyâ€™re prepared to fill theneeds of society. 
Over the last few years, STEM outreach has come a long way, however, I worry funding is becoming too unbalanced. 
Communities that already have a multitude of STEM opportunities are receiving too much funding whereas areas with very little STEM outreach receive too little. 
To solve this I created STEM Outreach Map, a tool that can help people better understand which areas lack STEM opportunities. 

Any data that you think would help to make this map more accurate would be greatly appreciated. You can contact me through my email, channinggaddy@gmail.com
